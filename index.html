		<p>Oh, said Ned Land, and where shall we be in six months, if you please, Sir Naturalist? Captain Nemo went out. Soon I discovered by a hissing noise that the water was entering the reservoirs. The Nautilus sank slowly, and rested on the ice at a depth of 350 yards, the depth at which the lower bank was immersed. The steersman is placed in a glazed box, that is raised above the hull of the Nautilus, and furnished with lenses. Now, professor, said he, if you wish to go over the Nautilus, I am at your service.</p>

Then, when the work was finished fire destroyed all trace of our proceedings on this island, that I could have jumped over if I had liked. Shells are all right-handed, with rare exceptions; and when by chance their spiral is left, amateurs are ready to pay their weight in gold. What a horrible beast! he cried.</p>
